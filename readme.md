# Star Crew


“StarCrew” is an application that allows player from around the world to find a crew for their mission depending on the language they speak, when they play and what they want to achieve.

A user can use “StarCrew” in two different ways, he can create his own mission and recruit other players or apply for other people’s missions and join a pre-existing crew.

An alpha version of the app is available[here](http://starcrew.black-star-initiative.com/)
